    Components can declare collisions, which are objects that will act as hitboxes. You can mix and match different collision types (points, boxes,cubes, polygons...) inside the <code>collision</code> object, each one will be represented as an array of objects, like this:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
    collision: {
            point: [
                { "#tag": "characterFeet", x: 0, y: 0},
            ],
            rectangle: [
                { "#tag": "bodyCollision", x: -50, y: -100, w: 100, h: 100 },
            ]
    }
</pre>
<p>
    As you can see, each collision object has the following fields:
    <ul>
        <li><code>#tag</code>: this is an unique indentifier that will allow you to use to modify your collider from your code.</li>
        <li><code>x</code>: The x position of the collision object, relative to the object position.</li>
        <li><code>y</code>: The y position of the collision object, relative to the object position.</li>
        <li>There can be more fields, depending on the type of the coliision object.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
