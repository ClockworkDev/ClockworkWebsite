<h2>Collisions</h2>

<p>
    Components can declare collisions, which are objects that will act as hitboxes. You can mix and match different collision types (points, boxes,cubes, polygons...) inside the <code>collision</code> object, each one will be represented as an array of objects, like this:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
    collision: {
            point: [
                { "#tag": "characterFeet", x: 0, y: 0},
            ],
            rectangle: [
                { "#tag": "bodyCollision", x: -50, y: -100, w: 100, h: 100 },
            ]
    }
</pre>
<p>
    As you can see, each collision object has the following fields:
    <ul>
        <li><code>#tag</code>: this is an unique indentifier that will allow you to use to modify your collider from your code.</li>
        <li><code>x</code>: The x position of the collision object, relative to the object position.</li>
        <li><code>y</code>: The y position of the collision object, relative to the object position.</li>
        <li>There can be more fields, depending on the type of the colision object.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    When two objects collide the <code>#collide</code> event is triggered on them, and data relative to the collision is made available thorugh the arguments of the event. Since each object can have several colision objects, not only the game object that has collided with the current one is reported, but also the type and tag of the specific colision objects:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
        {
            name: "#collide", code: function (event) {
                //The object that has collided with the current one
                event.object;
                //The type of the collision of this object that has collided
                event.shape1kind;
                //The type of the collision of the other object that has collided
                event.shape2kind
                //The #tag property of the collision of this object that has collided
                event.shape1tag
                //The #tag property of the collision of the other object that has collided
                event.shape2tag
            }
        }
</pre>
