Spritesheet.js is a library designed for rendering 2D spritesheet based games. In order to be rendered, objects have to be
associated to a spritesheet, that will specify how to draw them.


<p>There are four levels to consider when designing a spritesheet:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Frames</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Frames are just squares cropped from the image, and therefore are defined by

                <ul>
                    <li>X position</li>
                    <li>Y position</li>
                    <li>Width</li>
                    <li>Height</li>
                    <li>A frame duration (t) must also be specified, it indicates how long will that frame be shown in the screen.
                        A duration of 0 means that that frame will be shown as long as the animation continues.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Layers</strong>

        <ul>
            <li>Layers are ordered sets of frames that are displayed one after the other. Therefore they are defined by a list
                of frames, and they can also be moved specifying two functions: x(t) and y(t)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>States</strong>

        <ul>
            <li>States are a set of layers that are displayed at the same time on the screen, overlaying if necessary. Therefore
                they are just a list of layers.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Spritesheet</strong>

        <ul>
            <li>Spritesheets are the set of states, plus all of their associated layers and frames, and the image from which
                the frames should be extracted.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>For example, when animating a person walking, there could be two states: "Idle" and "Walking". Each state could be formed
    by several layers: "Body", "Arms", "Legs", and some layers could be reused in both states. Each layer could have several
    frames with the sucessive steps of the animation. Finally, the spritesheet should contain all of them, plus a reference
    to "someone_walking.png". </p>


<p>A XML file can describe one or multiple spritesheets and has the following structure:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-xml">&lt;<span class="pl-ent">spritesheets</span>&gt;
