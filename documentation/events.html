<h2>Events</h2>

<p>
    All the logic of your game will be inside the event handlers, which are functions that belong to an object and are executed
    when some event happens. They may modify the object itself and create more events, thus altering the state of your game.
</p>
<p>
    These are the three basic events that are received automatically by every object and you can implement:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <code>#setup</code>: Every object receives this event when it is spawned
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>#loop</code>: This event is executed on every object on every frame
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>#collide</code>: Whenever a collision is detected, this event is received on the objects colliding
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>#exit</code>: This event is executed on an object before it is destroyed (manually or by loading a new level)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    When an object receives an event, if it has the corresponding event handler it will be executed. An event handler looks like
    this:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
        {
            name: "#setup", code: function (data) {
                //This code is executed when the object is spawned
            }
        }
</pre>
<p>
    As you can see, it is a JavaScript function inside which you can do whatever you want, and the event might have some data
    associated that you will receive as the argument.
</p>
<p>
    In order to modify the object or interact with the engine you can use the <a onclick="loadDocumentationPage(this.dataset.target);return false;" data-target="objectAPI" href="#">Object API</a>.
