<h2>Packages</h2>

<p>
    You can use the Clockwork Package Manager to use existing packages to implement functionality in your game. If you have the
    CLI tools installed, you can run <code>clockwork list</code> to see the list of published packages, and run <code>clockwork add 'package name'</code> to
    add that package as one of the dependencies to your game.
</p>
<p>
    One you have added a package, you can run the <code>Browse Clockwork package documentation</code> command in the Visual
    Studio Code extension to see the documentation for that package. Packages will usually declare one or several components
    that you need to add to your level to use.
</p>
<p>
    You can also use the CLI tools to publish your own packages so they can be used by other developers!
