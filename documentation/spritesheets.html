<h2>Spritesheets</h2>

Spritesheets are files that are sent to the rendering library to describe how objects should be rendered. Spritesheets for the default rendering library, <a onclick="loadDocumentationPage(this.dataset.target);return false;" data-target="spritesheetdotjs" href="#">Spritesheet.js</a>, can be written in XML, but spritesheets for any other rendering library should be written in JSON.
<p>
Every rendering library exposes the same API, so you can find it <a href="https://github.com/ClockworkDev/RenderingLibraryInterface/blob/master/interface.js">here</a> if you are interested in writing your own.
