Levels are XML files which specify when and where will be the objects instantiated, allowing you to divide your game in independient
screens and instantiate the desired components in each one:
<pre class="prettyprint lang-xml">
&lt;levels&gt;
  &lt;level id="someName"&gt;
    &lt;object name="someName" type="someComponent" x="100" y="100" z="2" vars='{"w":90}'&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
	...
  &lt;/level&gt;
  ...
&lt;/levels&gt;
</pre>
You can specify as many levels as you want, and they must have unique names. When you load a level, all the objects that
it contains will be instantiated:
<ul>
    <li>
        name : Specifies a unique name for the object that will allow you to reference it from other objects.
    </li>
    <li>
        type : Specifies the component used to create the object.
    </li>
    <li>
        x, y, z: Specify the coordinates of the object. Z is not mandatory, but recomended even in 2d games to control the order
        in which objects are drawn.
    </li>
    <li>
        vars : JSON string containing variables to add to the object, they will be added to or overwrite the component variables.
    </li>
</ul>
