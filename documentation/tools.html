<h2>Tools</h2>

There are two ways to develop Clockwork games:
<ul>
    <li>
        <b><a href="#" onclick="loadDocumentationPage(this.dataset.target);return false;" data-target="cli">CLI tools</a></b>: This is a multiplatform command line program that allows you to develop Clockwork games while using your favorite code editor or IDE.
    </li>
        <li>
        <b><a href="#" onclick="loadDocumentationPage(this.dataset.target);return false;" data-target="vsce">VS Code Extension</a></b>: There is a Visual Studio Code extension that builds on top of the CLI tools and incorporates additional functionality, like debugging capabilities. <b>This is the recommended way to build Clockwork games</b>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Actually, that is not entirely true! There is a third way to make games, and that is using your own tools. You can take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/ClockworkDev/ClockworkTools">CLI tools NPM package</a> and use the functions it exposes to create your own tools or IDE plugins.
