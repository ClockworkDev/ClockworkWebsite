<p>
    By default there will be no loading screen between levels, but you can use loaders: they are objects provided by the developer
    that manage the loading screen.
</p>
<p>
    They must expose two methods, show and hide. This would be a sample loader:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
var defaultLoader = (function () {
    var div = document.createElement("div");
    div.style.height = '100%';
    div.style.width = '100%';
    div.style.display = 'block';
    div.style.position = 'absolute';
    div.style.backgroundColor = "black";
    div.style.color = "white";
    div.style.textAlign = "center";
    div.style.paddingTop ="40%";
    div.innerHTML = "Loading";
    div.style.top = '0px';
    div.style.left = '0px';
    document.body.appendChild(div);
    return {
        show: function () {
            div.style.visibility = "visible";
        },
        hide: function () {
            div.style.visibility = "hidden";
        }
    }
})();

this.engine.setLoader(defaultLoader);
</pre>
<p>
    They can be as simple or complicated as you want, and once you set them using <code class="prettyprint lang-js">setLoader</code>    they will show up between levels.
</p>
<p>
    The loaders are shown when you change the level, and are hidden once the <code class="prettyprint lang-js">#setup</code>    event of all objects has finished executing. This should be enough if you only write synchronous code, but if you use
    callbacks, promises or any kind of async method you will be interested on letting the engine know when you actually finish
    loading your level.
</p>
<p>
    This example shows how to instruct the engine to hide the loader once a callback has been executed.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
...
    {
        name: "#setup", code: function (lock) {
            lock.lock();
            asyncMethod(function () {
                lock.release();
            });
        }
    }
...
</pre>
<p>
    The <code class="prettyprint lang-js">#setup</code> event always receives a lock object, that you can safely ignore in
    synchronous code or, in this case, call its <code class="prettyprint lang-js">lock</code> method to make it wait until
    you call <code class="prettyprint lang-js">release</code>. It will behave like a semaphore, so you can lock and release
    as many times as you need and in any order, and once you have released it for each time you have locked it the engine will
    know you have finished setting up your object, and will execute the <code class="prettyprint lang-js">#setup</code> event
    of the next one. Once all the objects are finished, the loader will be hidden.
