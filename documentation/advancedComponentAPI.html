The <code>engine</code> object exposes more methods, but you should not need them unless you have very, very specific needs (that means that if you can find another way to it, it will be probably be more elegant and safe) since they take care of the functionality that is already handled by the Clockwork Runtime. Here they are:
<p>
<ul>
    <li><code>pause</code>: This function pauses the whole engine, so <code>#loop</code> events will stop happening.
    </li>
    <li><code>getRenderingLibrary</code>: This function returns the rendering library used by the game, so you can manually call the <a href="https://github.com/ClockworkDev/RenderingLibraryInterface/blob/master/interface.js"> methods it exposes </a> if needed.
    </li>
</ul>
