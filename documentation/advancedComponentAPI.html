The <code>engine</code> object exposes more methods, but you should not need them unless you have very specific needs since they take care of the functionality that is already handled by the Clockwork Runtime. Here they are:

<ul>
    <li><code>pause</code>: This function pauses the whole engine, so <code>#loop</code> events will stop happening.
    </li>
</ul>
