<h2>Components</h2>

<p>
    Components are like blueprints of the objects that you will later instantiate in your game: you can create a component for
    an enemy and then place hundreds of them in the level, or you can create an abstract component that will never be spawned.
</p>
<p>
    Each component has event listeners that will be triggered when some event happens, either to itself or to the whole level.
    It also has its own variables and colliders (those specify the hitboxes -except that they don't need to be boxes- of an object). If
    it should be rendered, it will also be associated with an spritesheet.
</p>
<p>
    You dont have to cram all the functionality of an specific type of object in a single component, actually you are encouraged
    to write 'minimal' components that encapsulate a specific behavior, and then use combine those components in your game
    objects and then use both the composition and inheritance pattern to create new components.
</p>
<p>
    Let's have a look at the component syntax:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
    {
        name: "componentName",
        sprite: "spritesheetName",
        inherits: ["baseComponent1", "baseComponent2"],
        events: [
            {
                name: "#setup", code: function (data) {
                    //This code is executed when the object is spawned
                }
            },
            {
                name: "#loop", code: function (data) {
                    //This code is executed every frame
                }
            }],
        collision: {
            box: [
                { "#tag": "myBoundingBox", x: 0, y: 0, w: 100, h: 100 },
            ]
        },
        vars: [
            { name: "isThisADemoComponent", value: true }
        ]
    }
</pre>
<p>
    As you can see, those are the properties that define a component:
    <ul>
        <li><code>name</code>: Specifies the preset name, it must be unique.</li>
        <li><code>sprite</code>: Specifies the spritesheet used to render the object.</li>
        <li><code>inherits</code>: A component can inherit from either a single component or a list of them.</li>
        <li><code>events </code>: The event handlers will contain all the logic of your game, they are functions that will be executed when some event happens.</li>
        <li><code>collision </code>:  Specifies the shapes that will act as hitboxes.</li>
        <li><code>vars </code>: Any variable that the object may need. You can also set them in the code, but if you define them here you can easily inherit and modify the values.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    In order to register your components so they can be later used (spawned or inherited from), you will need to register them, using this function:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
    CLOCKWORKRT.components.register([
    {
        //Component1
    },
    {
        //Component2
    },
    ...
    ]);
</pre>
