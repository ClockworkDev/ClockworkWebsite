    There is a Visual Studio Code extension that builds on top of the CLI tools and incorporates additional functionality, like
    debugging capabilities.
</p>

<p>
    It is available in the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arcadio.clockwork">VS Code marketplace</a>    and you can install it using the <code>ext install clockwork</code> command inside the editor.
</p>

<p>
    It provides commands for the following actions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Creating an starter Clockwork project (F1 > Create Clockwork Project)</li>
    <li>Packaging the project into a .cw file (F1 > Build Clockwork Project)</li>
    <li>Packaging a project and deploying it to the runtime (F1 > Deploy Clockwork Project)</li>
    <li>Debugging the game (Deploying it and then pressing F5)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The debugger allows to set breakpoints that will be triggered once the selected event handler is executed, and it shows the object and engine variables, the event stack and allows to evaluate JavaScript expressions.
