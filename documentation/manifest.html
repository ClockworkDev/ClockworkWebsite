<h2>Manifest</h2>

The manifest is a JSON file that can be found at the root of any project and contains basic information about the game.
Here you have the manifest from the starter project:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
    {
    "name": "gameName",
    "scope": "gameFiles",
    "components": [
        "components.js"
    ],
    "levels": [
        "levels.xml"
    ],
    "spritesheets":[
        "spritesheets.xml"
    ],
    "screenResolution": {
        "w": 1366,
        "h": 768
    },
    "dependencies": {},
    "themeColor":"#4B5",
    "backgroundColor":"#333",
    "tileIcon":"tileIcon.png",
    "enginefps": 60,
    "animationfps": 60
}
</pre>
